TO DO:

- [ ] I need to implement a dark mode, I started doing it manually with Tailwinds but it interferes with the NaiveUI styling, I decided to add NaiveUI for better input validation as it shows custom error messages, popups on loading or success etc.

- [X] Fix NaiveUI problems when deploying to Vercel

- [X] Write request so user can delete their own Tweets in real time

- [X] Write request so user can give or delete like from a tweet and update like count in real time, so there is no need to generate random like's count.
