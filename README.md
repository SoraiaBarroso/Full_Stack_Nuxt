TO DO:

- [ ] I need to implement a dark mode, I started doing it manually with Tailwinds but it interferes with the NaiveUI styling, I decided to add NaiveUI for better input validation as it shows custom error messages, popups on loading or success etc.

- [ ] Fix NaiveUI problems when deploying to Vercel
